# Win_Dialogs  
## aka CommonDialogs  
contains classes for the very often used typical windows dialogs:  
* ColorDialog  
* FontDialog  
* OpenFileDialog  
* SaveFileDialog  
* OpenFolderDialog (replaces FolderBrowserDialog)  



they work mostly the same as the correspondent classes from System.Windows.Forms.  
Project started in may 2006  
  
Special thanks go to Frank Sch√ºler for his great efforts on OpenFolderDialog
